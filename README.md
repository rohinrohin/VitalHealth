Medical records hold a lot of power. They can affect your insurance claims, they can impact what opportunities you are offered, they can decide what opportunities you are denied, and they even decide what happens to your assets after you are dead.
    
Thousands of medical records are misreported or forged everyday. Hundreds of decisions are made on false data. Some of which aren't disclosed to the victims.

A system that can be trusted to guarantee your data's authenticity and ownership without involving third parties, yet retaining accuracy and security is best build on a decentralized platform. VitalHeath is built on top of a blockchain to record your vital health parameters and protect them from abuse in case of a mishap.

This has been built using the blockapps framework employing smart contracts with solidity on the ethereum blockchain. To know more, you can look at our source code on Github. Our website is at vital-health.co
